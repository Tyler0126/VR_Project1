## My Project

For my project 1 scene, I created a simple room and built my own models as well as importing models into my project that I found online.
My project consists of a total of 15 models that I imported into the project from online resources as well as 8  models that
I created myself.

I will start by going over each individual model in my scene. 

The first object that allows for interactivity in my project is the two buttons on the grey mount that toggle Covid mode on and off
pictured below.

The green button toggles Covid mode on and the red button toggles it off.


The next 5 models are displayed in the screenshot below.

The dog is a model I got off of [https://poly.google.com/view/0BnDT3T1wTE](https://poly.google.com/view/0BnDT3T1wTE). This model also
allows for interactivity by making a barking noise when clicked. 

The desk is a model I created myself using 5 box tags and a texture I found off of google, which I will provide the link for the 
texture at the bottom of the report.

I also created the laptop model using 5 box tags and 3 images which I will provide at the end of the report as well.

The hand sanitizer model is a model I got off of [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hand-sanitizer-5ca4e17948fe40d1a73359116309ee1f](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hand-sanitizer-5ca4e17948fe40d1a73359116309ee1f).

The chair is an object that I created myself using 6 box tags and two iamges that I will provide the link for at the end of the report.

The next 8 models consist of a shelf and objeccts that I found online and they are in the screenshot below.

The shelf object is an object created by me using 6 box tags and positioning them together the right way. I also used the same
wood texture that I used for the desk, and the link will be provided at the end of the report.

The clock is an object I got from [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/simple-clock-617edd940bed42159139736f6a20abae](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/simple-clock-617edd940bed42159139736f6a20abae).

The TV is an object that I enjoyed making myself using 6 box tags, and it features two different screens for covid and non-covid mode.
I will provide the links to the images used for the TV model at the end of the report.

The furniture below the TV was also an object I created myself using 4 box tags.

The mask is a model that I found online at: [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/medical-mask-0b2bd5fe961e42b584648101e51bd68f](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/medical-mask-0b2bd5fe961e42b584648101e51bd68f).

The Xbox model looks really great under the TV and is a model I found at: [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/xbox-one-0e8615570e174fc5a1855dba94e63cf0](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/xbox-one-0e8615570e174fc5a1855dba94e63cf0).

The coffee table is an object that I created myself utilizing 5 box tags just like I did with the desk object.

The couch model is one that I took me a while to find, but I finally found one that I liked at: [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/couch-midcentury-modern-f8def3c5f656454c935fe3d626ed9fab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/couch-midcentury-modern-f8def3c5f656454c935fe3d626ed9fab).


The next screenshot features a Covid-19 timeline that I created myself as well as an R2D2 model I found online.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyler0126/Project1/master/images/Screenshot%20(142).png)

The Covid-19 timeline is something that I put together myself and enjoyed doing. The timeline featured in my project uses images
found at: [https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-timeline-tracking-critical-moments-covid-19-n1154341](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-timeline-tracking-critical-moments-covid-19-n1154341).

The R2D2 model was found online at: [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/r2d2-6b4016652d024566b8e25af378830657](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/r2d2-6b4016652d024566b8e25af378830657).
The R2D2 model can also be interacted with by clicking him. Doing so starts an animation that causes him to move across the room.



The dog barking sound was acquired online from the site: [http://www.orangefreesounds.com/category/sound-effects/animal-sounds/dog-sounds/](http://www.orangefreesounds.com/category/sound-effects/animal-sounds/dog-sounds/).
